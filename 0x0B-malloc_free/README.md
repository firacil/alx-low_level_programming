##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc` and `free`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar` .
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h` .


## Project Description
Learn about what is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation. What is `malloc` and `free` and how to use them. Why and when use `malloc`. How to use `valgrind` to check for memory leak.

* **0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee** - Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char. - `0-create_array.c`.
* **1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings** - Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter. - `1-strdup.c`.
* **2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life** - Write a function that concatenates two strings. - `2-str_concat.c`.
* **3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize** -Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers. - `3-alloc_grid.c`.
* **4. It's not bragging if you can back it up** - Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your `alloc_grid` function. - `4-free_grid.c`.
* **5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe** - Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program. - `100-argstostr.c`.
* **6. I will show you how great I am** - Write a function that splits a string into words. - `101-strtow.c`.

##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   You are not allowed to use the standard library unless stated otherwise. Any use of functions like  `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar` .
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `main.h`.


## Project Description
Pointers, arrays and strings.

* **0. memset** - Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte. - `0-memset.c`.
* **1. memcpy** - Write a function that copies memory area. - `1-memcpy.c`.
* **2. strchr** - Write a function that locates a character in a string. - `2-strchr.c`.
* **3. strspn** - Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring. - `3-strspn.c`.
* **4. strpbrk** - Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes. - `4-strpbrk.c`.
* **5. strstr** - Write a function that locates a substring. - `5-strstr.c`.
* **6. Chess is mental torture** -Write a function that prints the chessboard. - `7-print_chessboard.c`.
* **7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire** - Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers. - `8-print_diagsums.c`.
* **8. Double pointer, double fun** - Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char. - `100-set_string.c`.
* **9. My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure** - Create a file that contains the password for the `crackme2` executable. - `101-crackme_password`.

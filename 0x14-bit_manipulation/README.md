##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etc… is forbidden unless stated othewise.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.
*   All your header files should be include guarded.


## Project Description
Learn about bit and bit manipulation. Also involves the use of pointers.

* **0. 0** - Write a function that converts a binary number to `an unsigned int`. - `0-binary_to_uint.c`.
* **1. 1** - Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number. - `1-print_binary.c`.
* **2. 10** - Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index. - `2-get_bit.c`.
* **3. 11** - Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index. - `3-set_bit.c`.
* **4. 100** - Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index. - `4-clear_bit.c`.
* **5. 101** - Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another. - `5-flip_bits.c`.

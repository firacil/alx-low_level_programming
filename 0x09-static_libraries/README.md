##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   You are not allowed to use the standard library unless stated otherwise. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h` .

## Project Description
Learn about static libraries, how they work, how to create one and use it.

* **0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life** - Create the static library `libmy.a` containing all the functions listed in this task 0. - `libmy.a, main.h`.
* **1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future** - Create a script called `create_static_lib.sh` that creates a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory. - `create_static_lib.sh`.

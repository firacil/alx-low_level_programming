##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   You are not allowed to use the standard library unless stated otherwise. Any use of functions like  `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.

## Project Description.
Learn about pointers, arrays and strings. What are the differences between pointers and arrays. How to use strings and how to manipulate them. Scope of variables.

* **0. 98 Battery st.** - Write a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`. - `0-reset_to_98.c`.
* **1. Don't swap horses in crossing a stream** - Write a function that swaps the values of two integers. - `1-swap.c`.
* **2. 2. This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read** - Write a function that returns the length of a string. - ` 2-strlen.c`.
* **3. I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them** - Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to `stdout`. - `3-puts.c`.
* **4. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear** - Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. - `4-print_rev.c`.
* **5. A good engineer thinks in reverse and asks himself about the stylistic consequences of the components and systems he proposes** - Write a function that reverses a string. - `5-rev_string.c`.
* **6. Half the lies they tell about me aren't true** - Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. - `6-puts2.c`.
* **7. Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half** - Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. - `7-puts_half.c`.
* **8. Arrays are not pointers** - Write a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. - `8-print_array.c`.
* **9. strcpy** - Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`. - `9-strcpy.c`.
* **10. Great leaders are willing to sacrifice the numbers to save the people. Poor leaders sacrifice the people to save the numbers** - Write a function that convert a string to an integer. - `100-atoi.c`.
* **11. Don't hate the hacker, hate the code** - Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme. - `101-keygen.c`.
